# Yaffe-rs
Yet Another Frontend For Emulators is a project to bring all your emulators in one place, similar to EmulationStation or LaunchBox.
It was designed to be as simple as possible to use with a touch of customizability, and be extremely lightweight and fast.

## Features
Automatically downloads artwork and metadata for games
Steam-like overlay allows changing volume and exiting the currently running game
Filter games by name or number of players
Restricted mode to lock certain actions (such as launching a Mature rated game) behind a passcode
Keyboard and Xbox controller support
Windows and Linux (incomplete) support
Plugin system allows displaying your own items within the launcher (see yaffe-twitch and yaffe-plex)


While this program was mostly for my own needs, I will gladly consider pull requests
